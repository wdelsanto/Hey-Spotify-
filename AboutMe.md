# Hey Spotify!
Get to know me


I am Will Del Santo and I currently live in Wilton, CT! I live with my girlfriend and our dogs, Rylee and Moose.
Music is my passion and Spotify is my number one platform for streaming! I constantly have music playing -- helps me focus and inspires me as a musician and writer!
When I saw the opening for User Researcher, I had to jump on the opportunity. I studied psychology in undergrad and grad programs, so I absolutely love research and everything that comes with it!

My goal is to help Spotify achieve their mission and continue to deliver the best content to their listeners via User Interface and Design. I will truly listen to, and understand our users' needs and determine ways to ensure their lifelong commitment to Spotify.
